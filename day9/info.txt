TYPE CASTING
 =============================

 -----------------------------
 INTRODUCTION
  -----------------------------
  -> Type Casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.
  -> This is a common requirement in statically-typed programming languages like Java, C++, and C#.
  
  MAIN CATEGORIES:
   1. PRIMITIVE CASTING: Converting between fundamental data types (like int, double, char).
   2. NON-PRIMITIVE (OBJECT) CASTING: Converting between related class types (superclass and subclass).
  

 
 1. PRIMITIVE TYPE CASTING
    
  -----------------------------
  WIDENING CASTING (IMPLICIT)
   -----------------------------
   -> DEFINITION: The automatic conversion of a value from a smaller data type to a larger data type.
   -> Also known as "Implicit Casting" or "Upcasting" in the context of primitives.
   
   KEY PROPERTIES:
    ✅ This conversion is always SAFE, as there is no risk of data loss.
    ✅ It is performed automatically by the compiler; no special syntax is needed.
   
   CONVERSION FLOW:
    -> byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double
    -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
   
   EXAMPLE:
    int myInt = 100;
    double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic conversion from int to double
  
  -----------------------------
  NARROWING CASTING (EXPLICIT)
   -----------------------------
    -> DEFINITION: The manual conversion of a value from a larger data type to a smaller data type.
    -> Also known as "Explicit Casting" or "Downcasting" in the context of primitives.
    
    KEY PROPERTIES:
     -> ❌ This conversion is potentially UNSAFE and can result in DATA LOSS or overflow if the value is too large for the target type.
     -> ❌ It must be done MANUALLY by the programmer using cast syntax `(target_type)`.
    
    EXAMPLE:
     double myDouble = 9.78;
     int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual conversion from double to int
                                 // The value of myInt will be 9 (fractional part is lost)


 2. NON-PRIMITIVE (OBJECT) TYPE CASTING

  -> This involves converting an object of one class type to another within the same inheritance hierarchy.
 
  -----------------------------
  UPCASTING
   -----------------------------
   -> DEFINITION: The conversion of a subclass reference to a superclass reference.
   
   KEY PROPERTIES:
    ✅ This is always SAFE and is done IMPLICITLY (automatically).
    ✅ It is a form of generalization. The upcast object can only access the methods and variables defined in the superclass.
   
   EXAMPLE:
    // Given: class Animal {} and class Dog extends Animal {}
    
    Dog myDog = new Dog();
    Animal myAnimal = myDog; // Implicit upcasting from Dog to Animal
   
 
  -----------------------------
  DOWNCASTING
   -----------------------------
   -> DEFINITION: The conversion of a superclass reference back to its original subclass reference.
   
   KEY PROPERTIES:
    -> ❌ This is potentially UNSAFE. If the object being referenced is not actually an instance of the target subclass, a `ClassCastException` will be thrown at runtime.
    -> ❌ It must be done EXPLICITLY by the programmer using cast syntax `(subclass_type)`.
    -> It is often preceded by an `instanceof` check to ensure safety.
   
   EXAMPLE:
    // Continuing from the upcasting example...
    
    if (myAnimal instanceof Dog) {
      Dog anotherDog = (Dog) myAnimal; // Explicit downcasting from Animal to Dog
    }
