OOPS (OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)
 =============================

 -----------------------------
 1. OVERVIEW & DEFINITION
  -----------------------------
  DEFINITION:
   -> It is a design model or paradigm which helps the programmer to correlate
      real-world scenarios into the programming world in the form of objects.
  
  CORE COMPONENTS:
   -> ✅ STATES: Represented by Variables (Data fields).
   -> ✅ BEHAVIORS: Represented by Methods (Functions/Logic).
  
  THE 4 PILLARS OF OOPS:
   1. Encapsulation
   2. Inheritance
   3. Polymorphism
   4. Abstraction


 -----------------------------
 2. ENCAPSULATION
  -----------------------------
  DEFINITION:
   -> The process of binding or wrapping states (variables) and behaviors
      (methods) of an object together into a single unit (Class).
  
  PURPOSE:
   -> To achieve Data Hiding.


 -----------------------------
 3. DATA HIDING
  -----------------------------
  DEFINITION:
   -> The process of avoiding direct access to data while providing controlled
      access.
  
  HOW TO AVOID DIRECT ACCESS?
   -> By using Access Modifiers.
   -> ✅ KEYWORD: `private`
   -> RULE: If we make any member `private`, we cannot use that variable
      directly in a different class. It is directly accessible ONLY within the
      SAME class.
  
  HOW TO PROVIDE CONTROLLED ACCESS?
   -> By using Getter and Setter methods.


 -----------------------------
 4. GETTERS & SETTERS
  -----------------------------
  PURPOSE:
   -> To access `private` variables from outside the class in a secure way.
  
  GETTER METHOD:
   -> ✅ USE: Used to GET or retrieve the value of a private variable.
   -> typically has a return type matching the variable.
  
  SETTER METHOD:
   -> ✅ USE: Used to SET or modify the value of a private variable.
   -> Typically allows validation logic before assigning the value.


 -----------------------------
 5. PUBLIC CLASS RULE
  -----------------------------
  RULE:
   -> In a single source file, we can have ONLY ONE `public` class.
  
  CONSEQUENCE:
   -> ❌ ERROR: If we define two or more `public` classes in the same file, it
      will result in a Compile Time Error.
